# The OSR Webring Plugin

This is my attempt at recreating a webring, "... a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social." In this particular case the "specific theme" is around Old School Roleplaying games. Very educational!



## Installation

You can install this at Firefox Browser Add-Ons  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-osr-webring/ 

The Add-On will open a Sidebar (View->Sidebar) where you can coast through various OSR sites and read whatever strikes your fancy.
    
## Adding your Blog

You can submit your blog to the OSR webring via this form: https://forms.gle/XGfgExf6pagNpedD8

I've got some automation that will search for and add blogs every day at about 1a, which will get checked in and populated.

Also, please message me if you don't want your stuff included, no questions asked and no fuss. That said, I'm not the arbiter of stuff on the ring that you might find objectionable. I'm asking you to please not put me in a spot where I have to take down other peoples' content. Shit happens and I guess we'll deal with it when the time comes, but I want this to be about the community as much as possible. I'll definitely look at what people are submitting, but I'm not always hyper-aware of who's who in the hobby (excepting, of course, those explicitly named in the Subreddit rules).
